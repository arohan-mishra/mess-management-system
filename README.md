## About

Messes in VIT, owing to the large population of students, it is too time consuming and tedious to manage everything. In most messes, the entire management is done manually on paper. Due to COVID-19, this task has only become tougher as not all students can be allowed to eat in the mess at the same time. To remain safe during these times, there is a lot of importance to maintain social distance and hygiene and hence to address this issue, the need for a proper management system arises. This would allow the same operations to be performed within a short period of time and without expending much effort or manpower. 

The goal for making this project is to develop a mess management system for VIT in assembly language, while keeping the current pandemic situation in mind, which has made the systematic management of students even more difficult. For this project, we are implementing an 8086 Assembly language-based system which can store information of VIT students and the staff will be able to view and create time slots according to criteria, and sort the students based on different sorting parameters including college year, room number etc. The system would not only enable the management staff to manage students more efficiently and effortlessly, but would also allow students to book mess slots for eating food at their own convenience. Hence, it would greatly benefit the catering staff, students and the VIT administration and enforce better hygiene and safety complying with COVID standards during mess hours. 

## Features
1. Booking Mess Slot
The mess management system prompts the user to enter details such as the name of the student, the academic year the student is currently studying in, the hostel room number and the preferred time slot of the student. These student details are stored and the specific time slot is booked for the student.

2. Sorting students based on hostel room number
The students entered into the mess management system are sorted among the other students that share the same mess slot, based on the hostel room number of the student. This sorting leads to orderly management and conduct of mess activities.

3. Viewing number of students per time slot
For each booking per time slot, the count of students in that time slot is incremented, and the management system offers the functionality to check how many students have booked a particular slot out of the maximum number of bookings possible. 

4. Accommodating more number of students:
Due to unforeseen reasons, if some students are not able to go to the mess for a particular time for the given slot, the mess staff could make their slot booking in a last slot, accommodating them and keep this system real time.
